user_description: I am Pedro Emanuel Santana, 21 years old, a developer studying Software Engineering at UFC in Quixad√°. I have experience in competitive programming and mentoring in key courses. I am enthusiastic about C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript, and always open to new technologies. I have collaborated on innovative projects, such as using low-cost microcontrollers for teaching physics in schools in underprivileged areas of Pernambuco. I was a finalist in the Brazilian Informatics Olympiad and other competitions. I am seeking challenging opportunities to apply and expand my knowledge in software development.
